Sprint 3 Product Backlog:

Story Points (1 takes 1 hour):
Date Added  Status  User Story # Supported   Total Story Points  Story Points Completed  Task to be Done  Owner   Date Completed
* is a subpoint of a main story broken into smaller tasks

Simulation Class:
4/10  Open  Story 8  (4) (0) Give the ability to process per microsecond rates as well as per second rates  N/A   N/A
                     *(1) (0) Create Method to ask user if the inputted file is per second rates or per microsecond and then choose correct simul
                     *(2) (0) Create second instance of simulation that updates rate every microsecond from ratesList rather than every minute
                     *(1) (0) Verify all other functionality is maintained and the correct rate is being used on the correct microsecond
4/10  Open  Story 7  (8) (0) Implement Task Parallelism - split Simulation processing into an "Assembly Line"  N/A  N/A
                     *(1) (0) Create a method to specify how many threads will be used (ask the user)
                     *(5) (0) Implement Task Parallelism in the simulation by splitting it into threads to process more messages.
                     *(2) (0) Catch all threading errors --Error Checking (Unit Testing) to verify it works perfectly

csvReader:
4/10  Open  Story 8  (3) (0) Change csvReader from a set array length to a variable array length based on the length of the file  N/A  N/A
                     *(2) (0) Create method that reads file and gets # of lines (Size of array) don't read into array of hard coded size
                     *(1) (0) Test method creation with different sized files

Testing:
4/10  Open  Story 9  (4) (0) Create Manual Test Cases and Expected results  N/A   N/A
                     *(2) (0) Pick range of manual rates to be put into the file and manual processing speeds and buffer sizes
                     *(2) (0) Calculate the expected results using these manual rates and input parameters.
4/10  Open  Story 9  (3) (0) Create File that runs manual test cases and verifies expected results  N/A   N/A
                     *(1) (0) Have the file run Simulation for each test case when Tests.java is run
                     *(1) (0) Has the file run the same numbers for multiple processing units (file is a loop that runs 3 times, 1 unit etc)
                     *(1) (0) Extra Testing to verify the file operates correctly

Presentation:
4/10  Open  No Official Story - Just final presentation  (2) (0) Create Powerpoint in given structure   N/A   N/A


Sprint 2 Fixes (Unsure at the moment - will update when grades are given back)
