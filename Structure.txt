Buffer Class:

-Creates a Buffer with specified size to hold messages


Clock Class:

-Creates the clock being used for the Simulation
-Creates completely different clock from System Clock.


Simulation Class:

-Main Class that runs entire codebase
-Uses buffer class, csvReader class and Clock Class


Processing Unit Class:

-No idea
-Calculates Latency and Throughput????


CSV Reader Class:
-Reads CSV and parses into Array to be used for Data.


Message Class:

-To Be created
-Needs to represent each message
-stores input time into the system and time outputted from System


Questions for Professor Holdener:

1. Running simulation Questions
  - Inputting messages every nanosecond
  - Need a message Class
  - keep track of messages dropped if they don't fit in buffer when it checks
2. Do we need a GUI
3. Better method for tracking latency.
4. Test Plan - Require Unit Tests?
