Sprint 2 Product Backlog:

	Buffer:
		-Create buffer in a queue based on input buffer size
		-add messages to queue 
		-pop messages from queue
	
	Clock:
		-run Clock continuously
		-keeps track of current microsecond
		-notifies when 1 second, and 1 minute has passed
		
	Messages:
		-keeps track of input and ouput message times
		-calculate each messages latency
		
	Simulation:	
		-runs Clock
		-adds message to Buffer every nanosecond
		-pops message per time unit
		
	Test Plan:	
		-test buffer queue adding/popping
		-test clock times
		-implementation in Simulation
