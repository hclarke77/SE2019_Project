Test plan

Our test could divide into two part.

Unit test - To make sure all java classes could work. It includes function and logic test.

Integral test - To make sure our project could be use.


.Unit Test

ClockTest  -- Cloud it show micro, nano secode? Could it calculate latency?
CsvReaderTest -- Print read datas.
MessageTest  --  Print created message. Print travel time.
BufferTest  -- Print maximum buffer size.
ProcessTest  -- Using some data to simulate message. 

.Integral test
SimulationTest - Using message data to test simulation class. Could it get right output?


After finished test work, we should have a conclusion file:
Test Methods (Every test class's function)
Test Data    (normal, Maximum, Minimum, Boundary, and so on)
Test Report
